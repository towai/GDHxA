# GDHxA
This repo contains the beginnings of a Godot utility that reads a file of Eskil Steenberg's HxA (pronounced "haxa") format and loads it into a MeshInstance for viewing.

Currently hard-coded to load the teapot.hxa in the project's root directory, which is the very same one included with HxA itself.

Missing many features atm, but it *kind of* loads teapot.hxa (Godot ArrayMesh needs triangles and I would have to reimplement the triangulation util in GDScript somehow)

Please feel free to take this and expand upon it if so inclined
